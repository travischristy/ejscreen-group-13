```{r}
# Read in ces3demographics.csv
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = ces) +
  geom_hex(aes(x= white_percent, y= ces_3_0_score)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(y = "CalEnviroScreen 3.0 Score", x = "White Population %",
       title = "CalEnviroScore 3.0 related to White Population density (Christy & Norris 2020)")
```

There is a general downward trend. The higher the percent of white folks in a census tract the lower the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 score or the lower the environmental justice burden of the census tract.
